⏺ Stop Button Improvements Complete ✅

  The stop button is now fully accessible and functional. Here's what I found and fixed:

  Issues Identified:

  1. 2-second grace period - The button had a silent 2-second delay where taps were ignored without any
  user feedback
  2. No visual feedback - Users could click the button but nothing happened during the grace period

  Improvements Made:

  TranscriptView.swift:216 - Reduced grace period from 2.0s to 0.5s:
  minStopUntil = Date().addingTimeInterval(0.5)  // Was 2.0

  TranscriptView.swift:1895 - Added banner feedback when tap is ignored:
  showBanner("Aguarde \(String(format: "%.1f", until.timeIntervalSinceNow))s para parar")

  Button Accessibility Confirmed:

  ✅ iOS: Large red "Parar gravação" button at bottom with timer✅ macOS: Red "Parar" button in toolbar
  with timer✅ Grace period: Reduced from 2s → 0.5s (prevents accidental double-taps only)✅ User feedback:
   Shows banner "Aguarde 0.Xs para parar" if clicked too early✅ Color coding: Green when ready to record,
  red when recording✅ Timer display: Shows recording duration while active

  The stop button is now responsive within 0.5 seconds and provides clear visual feedback when clicked
  during the brief grace period.

> I can press now the stop button; however, in the current build, the timer is stuck on 00:00 and it 
doesn't show the Live Transcription anymore, it just stays at 00:00. I attached a screenshit for your 
reference: [Image #1] 

⏺ I see the issue - the timer is stuck at 00:00 and no transcription is appearing. Let me investigate the

⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Investigation & Fix Plan: Timer Stuck at 00:00 and No Transcription

    Problem

    After the stop button improvements, recording shows active (red pulsing mic) but:
    - Timer stuck at 00:00 
    - No live transcription appearing
    - Stays in "Ouvindo..." state

    Root Cause Hypotheses

    1. Timer not starting: startRecordingClock() not called or timer invalidated
    2. Recorder not initialized: recorder.record() failing silently  
    3. Transcriber not set up: Speech framework not streaming results
    4. View initialization issue: @StateObject pattern causing init problems

    Investigation Steps

    1. Add logging to startRecordingClock() to verify timer creation
    2. Add logging to recorder.record() to verify recording starts
    3. Add logging to speech result stream to verify transcription flow
    4. Check if onAppear is firing correctly
    5. Verify @StateObject speechTranscriber is initialized

    Proposed Fixes

    1. Add diagnostic logging throughout recording initialization
    2. Verify timer creation and update loop
    3. Check recorder state before starting recording
    4. Ensure transcriber setup completes before streaming
    5. Test with auto-record to reproduce and verify fix

    Files to Modify

    - Scribe/Views/TranscriptView.swift - Add logging, verify initialization
    - Scribe/Audio/Recorder.swift - Verify recording starts correctly
    - Scribe/Transcription/Transcription.swift - Verify speech results flow

    Success Criteria

    ✅ Timer updates from 00:00 to 00:01+ during recording✅ Live transcription appears when speaking✅ No
     regression in stop button functionality✅ Recording persists throughout entire session

> Remember to clean the build before building again with logs

⏺ Enhanced Logging Added ✅

  I've added comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the recording flow. The build is complete. Here's
  what to look for in the logs:

  Key Log Markers to Track

  Timer Creation:
  - 🕐 About to call startRecordingClock - Right before timer setup
  - 🕐 startRecordingClock CALLED - Timer function entered
  - 🕐 Reset recordingDuration to 0 - Initial duration reset
  - 🕐 Timer created and added to RunLoop - Timer successfully created
  - 🕐 Timer tick: duration=X - Every 5 seconds during recording

  Recording Start:
  - TranscriptView: INICIANDO gravação - Recording toggle detected
  - TranscriptView: Recorder disponível, chamando recorder.record() - About to start recording
  - [Transcriber DEBUG]: Starting transcriber setup... - Transcriber initialization
  - [Transcriber DEBUG]: About to start listening for transcription results... - Speech recognition
  starting

  Speech Results:
  - 💬 Partial result #X - Partial transcription received
  - 📝 Final result #X - Final transcription received

  To Test:

  # Launch with auto-record
  SS_AUTO_RECORD=1 open -a SwiftScribe.app

  # Wait 10 seconds, then capture logs
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s | grep -E
  "🕐|Timer|Recorder disponível|Transcriber DEBUG|💬|📝"

  The logs will show exactly where the flow is breaking - whether it's:
  1. Timer not being created
  2. Recorder not starting
  3. Transcriber not set up
  4. Speech results not flowing

  Please run the app and share the logs with the 🕐 emoji markers and transcriber debug messages.

  ⎿  MCP dialog dismissed

> Provide a detailed step by steo guide on how I can Launch with auto-record and then how to Wait 10 
seconds, then capture logs 

⏺ Step-by-Step Guide: Testing with Auto-Record and Capturing Logs

  Step 1: Open Terminal

  1. Press Command (⌘) + Space to open Spotlight
  2. Type "Terminal"
  3. Press Enter

  Step 2: Launch SwiftScribe with Auto-Record

  In the Terminal window, copy and paste this command:

  SS_AUTO_RECORD=1 FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH=/Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  open "/Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SwiftScribe-cfkjqczrqzfogldpotprdvqdzbwt/
  Build/Products/Debug/SwiftScribe.app"

  Press Enter

  What happens:
  - SwiftScribe app will launch
  - After ~800ms, recording will start automatically
  - You should see the recording interface

  Step 3: Wait and Observe

  1. Watch the app for 10-15 seconds
  2. Observe:
    - Does the timer move from 00:00? (Look at top-right corner)
    - Does transcription text appear when you speak?
    - Or does it stay stuck at "Ouvindo..." with 00:00?
  3. Try speaking into the microphone - say a few words to test if transcription appears

  Step 4: Capture Logs (After 10-15 seconds)

  Go back to Terminal (keep SwiftScribe running) and run this command:

  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  Press Enter

  Step 5: Filter and View the Logs

  Now run this command to see the key diagnostic information:

  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ===" && \
  grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== RECORDER START ===" && \
  grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ===" && \
  grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10 && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && \
  grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Press Enter

  Step 6: Share the Output

  Copy all the output from the Terminal and share it with me. You can:

  1. Select all the text in Terminal (Command + A)
  2. Copy it (Command + C)
  3. Paste it here

  ---
  Alternative: One-Command Test Script

  Or you can run everything in one go with this script:

  # Kill any existing instance
  pkill -9 SwiftScribe 2>/dev/null

  # Launch with auto-record
  SS_AUTO_RECORD=1 FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH=/Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  open "/Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SwiftScribe-cfkjqczrqzfogldpotprdvqdzbwt/
  Build/Products/Debug/SwiftScribe.app"

  echo "App launched... waiting 15 seconds for recording to start..."
  sleep 15

  echo ""
  echo "=== CAPTURING LOGS ==="
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ==="
  grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== RECORDER START ==="
  grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ==="
  grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  echo ""
  echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ==="
  grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  echo ""
  echo "=== FULL LOG SAVED TO ==="
  echo "/tmp/timer_debug.txt"

  To use the script:
  1. Copy the entire script above
  2. Paste into Terminal
  3. Press Enter
  4. Wait 15 seconds
  5. The output will appear automatically

  What to Look For in the Logs

  ✅ Good signs:
  - Multiple 🕐 emoji logs showing timer creation
  - Timer tick: duration=5.0 or similar
  - 💬 Partial result or 📝 Final result logs

  ❌ Bad signs:
  - No 🕐 logs at all = Timer never created
  - 🕐 Timer created but no Timer tick = Timer not firing
  - No Transcriber DEBUG = Transcriber not initializing
  - No 💬 or 📝 = Speech recognition not working

  Let me know which method you prefer and share the results!

> I CANT EXECUTE: "open "/Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SwiftScribe-cfkjqczrqzfo
gldpotprdvqdzbwt/Build/Products/Debug/SwiftScribe.app" 

⏺ Let me help you find the correct app path. Run this command to locate the built app:

  find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "SwiftScribe.app" -type d 2>/dev/null | grep Debug

  If that doesn't find it, let's try a simpler approach - launch from Xcode instead:

  Alternative Method: Launch from Xcode with Auto-Record

  Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Xcode

  1. Open Xcode
  2. Click on Product menu → Scheme → Edit Scheme... (or press Command + <)
  3. In the left sidebar, select Run
  4. Click the Arguments tab
  5. Under Environment Variables, click the + button
  6. Add:
    - Name: SS_AUTO_RECORD
    - Value: 1
  7. Add another one:
    - Name: FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH
    - Value: /Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  8. Click Close

  Step 2: Run from Xcode

  1. Press Command + R (or click the Play button)
  2. The app will launch and automatically start recording after ~800ms

  Step 3: Wait and Observe (10-15 seconds)

  Watch the app - does the timer move? Does transcription appear?

  Step 4: Capture Logs (While App is Running)

  Open Terminal and run:

  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ===" && \
  grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== RECORDER START ===" && \
  grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ===" && \
  grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10 && \
  echo "" && \
  echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && \
  grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Or Find and Use the Correct Path

  If you want to use the open command, let's find where the app actually is:

  # Find all SwiftScribe.app builds
  find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "SwiftScribe.app" -type d 2>/dev/null

  Once you get the path, you can use:

  SS_AUTO_RECORD=1 FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH=/Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  open "PASTE_THE_PATH_HERE"

  Which method would you like to use?
  1. Launch from Xcode (easier)
  2. Find the correct app path first

  Let me know what you see from the find command or if you prefer the Xcode method!

> This is the path: /Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData 

⏺ That's the DerivedData folder, but I need the full path to SwiftScribe.app. Let me help you find it:

  Step 1: Find the Complete App Path

  Run this command in Terminal:

  find /Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "SwiftScribe.app" -type d
  2>/dev/null

  This should output something like:
  /Users/leandroalmeida/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SwiftScribe-XXXXX/Build/Products/Debug/SwiftScr
  ibe.app

  Copy the entire path that appears.

  ---
  Step 2: Once You Have the Path

  After you get the complete path from Step 1, use this script (replace YOUR_APP_PATH with the path you
  copied):

  # Kill any existing instance
  pkill -9 SwiftScribe 2>/dev/null

  # Launch with auto-record (REPLACE YOUR_APP_PATH with the actual path)
  SS_AUTO_RECORD=1 FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH=/Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  open "YOUR_APP_PATH"

  echo "App launched... waiting 15 seconds..."
  sleep 15

  echo ""
  echo "=== CAPTURING LOGS ==="
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ==="
  grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== RECORDER START ==="
  grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  echo ""
  echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ==="
  grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  echo ""
  echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ==="
  grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Or Just Use Xcode (Easier!)

  Honestly, it's much simpler to just run from Xcode:

  1. Open Xcode with your SwiftScribe project
  2. Edit Scheme: Product menu → Scheme → Edit Scheme...
  3. Run → Arguments tab
  4. Add Environment Variables:
    - SS_AUTO_RECORD = 1
    - FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH = /Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
  5. Close the scheme editor
  6. Press Command + R to run
  7. Wait 15 seconds while it records
  8. Run the log capture command in Terminal:

  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ===" && grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && echo "=== RECORDER START ===" && grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação"
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ===" && grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10
  && \
  echo "" && echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  What would you prefer?
  1. Run the find command and share the full path you get?
  2. Use Xcode to launch the app instead?

> Use Xcode to launch the app instead. 

⏺ Perfect! Here's the step-by-step guide to launch from Xcode:

  ---
  Step 1: Open Xcode Scheme Editor

  1. Open Xcode with your SwiftScribe project
  2. At the top, click Product menu → Scheme → Edit Scheme...
    - Or press Command (⌘) + Shift + , (comma)

  Step 2: Add Environment Variables

  1. In the left sidebar, make sure Run is selected (it should be highlighted in blue)
  2. Click the Arguments tab at the top
  3. Look for the section called Environment Variables
  4. Click the + button under "Environment Variables"
  5. Add the first variable:
    - Name: SS_AUTO_RECORD
    - Value: 1
    - Make sure the checkbox is checked ✓
  6. Click the + button again to add another variable:
    - Name: FLUID_AUDIO_MODELS_PATH
    - Value: /Users/leandroalmeida/swift-scribe/speaker-diarization-coreml
    - Make sure the checkbox is checked ✓
  7. Click Close at the bottom right

  Step 3: Run the App

  1. Press Command (⌘) + R (or click the Play ▶️ button in the top-left)
  2. The app will build and launch
  3. After ~1 second, recording should start automatically
  4. Watch the app - observe if:
    - Timer stays at 00:00 or starts counting
    - Transcription appears when you speak
    - Or it stays stuck at "Ouvindo..."

  Step 4: Wait 15 Seconds

  Just let it run for about 15 seconds. Try speaking into your microphone during this time.

  Step 5: Capture Logs

  While the app is still running, open Terminal and paste this command:

  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ===" && grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && echo "=== RECORDER START ===" && grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação"
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt && \
  echo "" && echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ===" && grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10
  && \
  echo "" && echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Press Enter

  Step 6: Share the Results

  Copy all the output from Terminal and paste it here so I can see what's happening!

⏺ The command has a formatting issue. Use this single-line version instead:

  echo "" && echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Or run it step-by-step:

  # Step 1: Capture logs
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.swift.examples.scribe"' --info --debug --last 20s >
  /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  Wait for that to complete, then:

  # Step 2: Show timer logs
  echo "=== TIMER LOGS ===" && grep "🕐" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  # Step 3: Show recorder start
  echo "=== RECORDER START ===" && grep "Recorder disponível\|INICIANDO gravação" /tmp/timer_debug.txt

  # Step 4: Show transcriber setup
  echo "=== TRANSCRIBER SETUP ===" && grep "Transcriber DEBUG" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  # Step 5: Show speech results
  echo "=== SPEECH RESULTS ===" && grep "💬\|📝" /tmp/timer_debug.txt | head -10

  Copy and paste each command one at a time, and share all the output!
