## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate AuroraToolkit into your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/AuroraToolkit/AuroraCore.git", from: "0.9.2")
```

Then add the desired modules as dependencies to your target. For example:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "AuroraCore", package: "AuroraToolkit"),
        .product(name: "AuroraLLM", package: "AuroraToolkit"),
        .product(name: "AuroraML", package: "AuroraToolkit"),
        .product(name: "AuroraTaskLibrary", package: "AuroraToolkit")
    ]
),
```

You can include only the modules you need in your project to keep it lightweight and focused.


## Usage

### Setting up a Context

```swift
import AuroraLLM

let contextController = ContextController(maxTokenLimit: 4096)
contextController.addItem(content: "This is a new item.")
let summary = contextController.summarizeContext()
```

### Using Workflows and Tasks

```swift
import AuroraCore

let workflow = Workflow(name: "Example Workflow", description: "This is a sample workflow") {
    Workflow.Task(name: "Task_1", description: "This is the first task.")
    Workflow.Task(name: "Task_2", description: "This is the second task.") { inputs in
        // Perform some task-specific logic
        return ["result": "Task 2 completed."]
    }
}

await workflow.start()

print("Workflow completed. Result: \(workflow.outputs["Task_2.result"] as? String)")
```

### LLM Integration

```swift
import AuroraLLM

let llmManager = LLMManager()
llmManager.registerService(OllamaService(name: "Ollama"))

let request = LLMRequest(prompt: "Hello, World!")
llmManager.sendRequest(request) { response in
    print(response?.text ?? "No response")
}
```

### Domain Routing Examples

#### Siri-Style On-Device Routing (CoreMLDomainRouter)
Use a `.mlmodelc` classifier to predict whether a prompt should be handled on-device, off-device, or marked as "unsure." Perfect for Siri-style domain separation.

```swift
let router = CoreMLDomainRouter(
    name: "PrimaryRouter",
    modelURL: modelPath(for: "SiriStyleTextClassifier.mlmodelc"),
    supportedDomains: ["private", "public", "unsure"]
)
```

#### Logic-Based Domain Routing (LogicDomainRouter)
Use a custom logic-based router to determine the domain based on privacy rules:

```swift
    let privacyRouter = LogicDomainRouter(
        name: "Privacy Gate",
        supportedDomains: ["private","public"],
        rules: [
            .regex(name:"Credit Card",
                   pattern:#"\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b"#,
                   domain:"private", priority:100),
            .regex(name:"US Phone",
                   pattern:#"\b\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b"#,
                   domain:"private", priority:100),
            .regex(name: "Email",
                   pattern: #"[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}"#,
                   domain: "private",
                   priority: 100),
            .regex(name: "SSN",
                   pattern: #"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b"#,
                   domain: "private",
                   priority: 100)
        ],
        defaultDomain: "public",
        evaluationStrategy: .highestPriority
    )
```

## Running Tests

AuroraToolkit includes tests for multiple language model services. The Ollama tests will always run, as they do not require any API keys. For testing Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI services, you will need to manually provide your API keys.

### .env example

To simplify adding environment variables for API keys, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your API keys.

### Adding API Keys for Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI:

Some test and example files use OpenAI or Anthropic services and need API keys to function correctly. To use these services, add the following keys to the `AuroraToolkit-Package` and `AuroraExamples` schemes. Make sure these schemes are not shared, and take extra precaution to avoid committing API keys into the repository.

- For Anthropic, add the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with a valid test API key.
- For Google, add the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with a valid test API key.
- For OpenAI, add the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with a valid test API key.
- Ollama does not require API keys, but does require the Ollama service to be running at the default service URL, `http://localhost:11434`.
- FoundationModel does not require API keys, but does require iOS/visionOS/macOS 26+.

### Important:
- **Never commit your API keys to the repository**. The tests are designed to run with Ollama by default, and you can enable additional tests for Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI by manually adding your keys for local testing.
- Be sure to remove or replace your keys with empty strings before committing any changes.

With this setup, you can run the tests on multiple LLMs and ensure your sensitive keys are not inadvertently shared.

## Documentation

AuroraToolkit uses Swift-DocC for comprehensive, interactive documentation. The documentation is organized by module and includes API references, tutorials, and practical examples.

### Generating Documentation

#### Quick Generation
For local development and testing, use the quick generation script:

```bash
./generate-docs.sh
```

This generates DocC archives for all modules in `.build/plugins/Swift-DocC/outputs/`.

#### Full Build with Web Export
For production builds and web hosting, use the comprehensive build script:

```bash
./build-docs.sh
```

This script:
- Generates DocC archives for all modules
- Exports web-ready HTML documentation to `./docs/`
- Prepares documentation for static hosting

### Viewing Documentation

#### Archive Format (Recommended)
Open `.doccarchive` files directly with Xcode for the best viewing experience:

```bash
# Open a specific module
open docs/AuroraCore.doccarchive

# Or open all modules at once
open docs/*.doccarchive

# Or from build output
open .build/plugins/Swift-DocC/outputs/AuroraCore.doccarchive
```

#### Preview Mode (For Active Development)
Use Swift-DocC's built-in preview mode for live documentation development:

```bash
# Preview with auto-reload during development
swift package --disable-sandbox preview-documentation --target AuroraCore

# Preview opens in your browser with live updates as you edit documentation
```

### Documentation Structure

Each module includes:
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation of all public interfaces
- **Getting Started**: Quick start guides with code examples
- **Architecture**: Design patterns and module organization
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases

## Future Ideas

- **On-device LLM support**: Integrate with on-device language models to enable fast, private, and offline AI capabilities.
- **Multimodal LLM support**: Enable multimodal LLMs for use cases beyond plain text.
- **Advanced Workflow features**: Include prebuilt workflow templates for common AI tasks (e.g., summarization, Q&A, data extraction) to jumpstart development.

## Testing

AuroraToolkit includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for all modules.
Note: LLM integration tests (using OllamaService) may occasionally exhibit non-deterministic failures due to model response variability.
If an LLM test fails unexpectedly, please re-run the test suiteâ€”such failures are typically transient and not indicative of regressions.
