/// An example demonstrating a Siri-style, privacy-focused domain routing scenario.
///
///    This example uses a CoreML model to classify user prompts into three domains:
///    - Private: Prompts that should be handled locally on the device.
///    - Public: Prompts that can be sent to a server for processing.
///    - Unsure: Prompts that are ambiguous and should be handled locally.
///
///    The example includes a set of test cases to evaluate the model's performance.
///    The model is expected to classify prompts correctly based on their context.
///
///    This example aims for 100% accuracy in domain classification, for user safety.
