/// `AnalyzeTextReadabilityTask` analyzes the readability of input strings using an LLM service.
///
/// - **Inputs**
///    - `strings`: The list of strings to analyze for readability.
///    - `maxTokens`: The maximum number of tokens allowed for the LLM response. Defaults to 500.
///
/// - **Outputs**
///    - `readabilityScores`: A dictionary where keys are the input strings and values are their readability scores (e.g., Flesch–Kincaid grade level, average word length).
///    - `thoughts`: An array of strings containing the LLM's chain-of-thought entries, if any.
///    - `rawResponse`: The original unmodified raw response text from the LLM.
///
/// ### Use Cases
/// - Assess the complexity of text content for target audiences.
/// - Pre-process content to ensure it meets accessibility standards.
/// - Compare readability metrics across different content pieces.

            Analyze the readability of the following strings.
            Return the result as a JSON object with each input string as a key and its readability metrics as values. Include metrics like Flesch–Kincaid grade level and average word length.

            Example (for format illustration purposes only):
            Input Strings:
            - "This is a simple sentence."
            - "Using complex syntax and intricate word choice, the author conveyed their ideas."

            Output JSON:
            {
                "This is a simple sentence.": {
                  "FleschKincaidGradeLevel": 2.3,
                  "AverageWordLength": 4.2
                },
                "Using complex syntax and intricate word choice, the author conveyed their ideas.": {
                  "FleschKincaidGradeLevel": 12.5,
                  "AverageWordLength": 6.8
                }
            }

            Important Instructions:
            1. Only analyze the readability metrics of the input strings provided.
            2. Use the Flesch–Kincaid grade level and average word length as the primary metrics.
            3. Do not infer or guess the meaning of the strings—analyze only the readability.
            4. Do not include any additional text, explanations, code, or examples in the output.
            5. Ensure the JSON object is properly formatted and valid.
            6. Ensure the JSON object is properly terminated and complete. Do not cut off or truncate the response.
            7. Do not include anything else, like markdown notation around it or any extraneous characters. The ONLY thing you should return is properly formatted, valid JSON and absolutely nothing else.
            8. Only process the following texts:

            \(resolvedStrings.joined(separator: "\n"))
            """
