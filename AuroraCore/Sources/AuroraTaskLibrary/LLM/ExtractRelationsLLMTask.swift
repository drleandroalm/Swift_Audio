/// `ExtractRelationsLLMTask` extracts relationships between entities mentioned in the input strings.
///
/// - **Inputs**
///    - `strings`: The list of strings to analyze for relationships.
///    - `relationTypes`: Optional predefined types of relationships to extract (e.g., "works_at", "located_in").
///    - `maxTokens`: The maximum number of tokens allowed for the LLM response. Defaults to 500.
///
/// - **Outputs**
///    - `relations`: A dictionary where keys are relationship types and values are arrays of tuples representing the entities involved in the relationship.
///    - `thoughts`: An array of strings containing the LLM's chain-of-thought entries, if any.
///    - `rawResponse`: The original unmodified raw response text from the LLM.
///
/// ### Use Cases:
/// - Extract organizational structures, geographical locations, or professional roles from text.
/// - Analyze structured relationships in unstructured data.
/// - Create knowledge graphs for downstream tasks.
///
/// ### Example:
/// **Input Strings:**
/// - "Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, headquartered in San Francisco."
/// - "Elon Musk founded SpaceX and Tesla."
///
/// **Output JSON:**
///
/// ```
/// {
///     "relations": {
///         "works_at": [["Sam Altman", "OpenAI"]],
///         "located_in": [["OpenAI", "San Francisco"]],
///         "founded": [["Elon Musk", "SpaceX"], ["Elon Musk", "Tesla"]]
///     }
/// }

            Example (for format illustration purposes only):
            Input Strings:
            - "Steve Jobs was the co-founder of Apple, headquartered in Cupertino, California."
            - "Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs."

            Output JSON:
            {
              "co_founded": [["Steve Jobs", "Apple"], ["Steve Wozniak", "Apple"]],
              "located_in": [["Apple", "Cupertino, California"]]
            }

            Important Instructions:
            1. Analyze the input strings and identify explicit relationships between entities.
            2. Use concise relationship types and entity names.
            3. Do not infer or guess relationships—only extract those explicitly stated.
            4. Return a JSON object with relationship types as keys and arrays of entity pairs as values.
            5. Ensure the JSON object is properly formatted and valid.
            6. Ensure the JSON object is properly terminated and complete. Do not cut off or truncate the response.
            7. Do not include anything else, like markdown notation around it or any extraneous characters. The ONLY thing you should return is properly formatted, valid JSON and absolutely nothing else.
            8. Only analyze the following texts:

            \(resolvedStrings.joined(separator: "\n"))
