    /// - Parameters:
    ///    -  topP: The top probability value used for nucleus sampling.
    ///    -  frequencyPenalty: A penalty to discourage token repetition in the response.
    ///    -  presencePenalty: A penalty to encourage the introduction of new tokens in the response.
    ///    -  stopSequences: An optional array of strings that will stop the response generation when encountered.
    ///    -  logitBias: An optional dictionary that maps tokens to biases, allowing adjustment of token probabilities.
    ///    -  user: An optional string representing a user identifier for tracking purposes.
    ///    -  suffix: An optional string that will be added after the model's response.
    ///    -  preferredDomains: An optional array of strings representing preferred domains for routing.
