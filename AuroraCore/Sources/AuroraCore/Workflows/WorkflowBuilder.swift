/// A result builder designed to construct workflows using a declarative syntax.
///
/// The `WorkflowBuilder` enables developers to define workflows with a clean and concise structure,
/// allowing for the creation of `Workflow` objects containing `TaskGroup` and `Task` instances.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let workflow = Workflow(name: "Sample Workflow", description: "An example workflow") {
///     Workflow.TaskGroup(name: "Group 1", description: "First group") {
///         Workflow.Task(name: "Task 1", description: "Perform task 1") { _ in
///             ["result": "Task 1 complete"]
///         }
///         Workflow.Task(name: "Task 2", description: "Perform task 2", inputs: ["result": nil]) { inputs in
///             guard let result = inputs["result"] as? String else { return [:] }
///             return ["output": "\(result), and Task 2 complete"]
///         }
///     }
///     Workflow.Task(name: "Task 3", description: "Independent task") { _ in
///         ["final": "Workflow complete"]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// - Note: The `WorkflowBuilder` is used to construct workflows in a declarative manner. Components in a workflow must conform to the
/// `WorkflowComponent` protocol, which provides a unified interface for tasks and task groups.
